title: Why decentralization
---

In verifiable elections, the voting list is publicly available.

We examine how voters prove their identity in centralized and decentralized systems.

**Centralized systems** uses a cryptographic hash of the credential. When they receive credential they can verify the hash and without having to store the credential.

But observators cannot verify the voter identity without knowing the credential. They have to trust that the server manage the ballot list honestly. 

**Decentralized systems** often uses digital signatures.
A signing public key is associated to every voter.

Everyone can now verify by themselves that the ballot is emitted by the person owning the credential.
We don't even need a server at all.
